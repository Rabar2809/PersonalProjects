Welcome to my page, am new to be honest in GitHub and don't really know how to use it, 
but I've uploaded all of my personal and academic projects that I have done during in University. 

One is made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the other one is an mobile app made with flutter attached in a text file because of the file size.
